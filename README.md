ðŸ§¾ Brief code explanation 
This project shows the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) from the SOLID principles.

A Discount interface defines a general rule for discounts.

Each class (FixedDiscount, PercentageDiscount, LoyaltyDiscount, BirthdayDiscount) adds a different discount strategy.

The Store class uses the interface to apply any discount type.

In the Main class, we run examples showing the result of each discount.

ðŸ“Œ Key idea: We can add new discount types by creating new classes â€” without changing the existing code. Thatâ€™s how we follow OCP.
